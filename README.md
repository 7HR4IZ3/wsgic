```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser to see the demo in action.

## Features

WSGIC includes the following features:

- Routing: WSGIC includes a flexible routing system based on URL patterns.
- Middleware: WSGIC supports middleware components that can modify requests and responses.
- Templates: WSGIC includes a simple templating engine for generating HTML.
- Static files: WSGIC can serve static files from a directory on the filesystem.
- Customizable: WSGIC is designed to be easy to customize and extend, so you can add your own functionality as needed.

## Example

Here's an example of how to create a simple "Hello, world!" application in WSGIC:

```python
from wsgic import WSGIApp
from wsgic.routing.map import MapRouter

router = MapRouter()
routes = router.routes

@routes.get("/")
def index():
    return "Hello, world!"

app = WSGIApp(router=router)
application = app.wrapped_app("wsgi")
```
